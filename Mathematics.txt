Permutation - It is the systematic arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, where 
the order of objects matters. 
Formulae - P(n, r) = n!/ (n-r)! where n is total set of items and r is items to be arranged
Example - Choose 2 winners who will get gold and silver out of total 10 people. (n = 10, r = 2)
1st person gets gold, 2nd gets silver is not same as 2nd gets gold and 1st silver
123 =! 321
Permutation without repetition of element - P(n, r) = n!/(n-r)!
Permutation with repetition of element - P(n, r) = n**r;

Combination - it is a way of selecting items from a collection such that the order of
selection does not matter.
Formulae - C (n , r) = n!/ r!(n - r)!
Example - Choose 3 friends to go on trip from 10 friends. Here it does not matter who is 
chosen first. 
1st friend chosen to go 1st and 2nd chosen to go 2nd is same as 2nd chosen to go 1st and
1st chosen to go 2nd. 

Key Diff
Feature            Permutation                     Combination
Focus              Arrangement or Sequence         Selection or grouping
Order              Matters(eg 123 != 321)          Does not matter(eg {A, B} == {B, A})
Outcomes           Always more(multiple per group) Always Fewer(redundancy is removed)
